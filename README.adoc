LADI is a long term initiative for improving audio media creation and
production experience on Libre operating systems.

LADI releated software is being deployed on POSIX systems running

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JACK_Audio_Connection_Kit[JACK Audio Connection Kit]
and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D-Bus[D-Bus].

A partial list of projects sustained under LADI umbrella
is provided below. Some of them got more popular than others
and lot was adopted in unanticipated way, for good.

 * jackdbus (mainlined as part of jack2, but initially crafted for jack1)
 * laditools
 * ladish
 * a2jmidid

Recently, the LADIOS effort aims at providing installable OS
images (Gentoo Linux is used as base).

Participation in LADI project, including but not limited to
contribution of source code, documentation and support is
bound to code of conduct.

Currently there is only one accepted code of conduct,
the https://launchpad.net/codeofconduct/2.0["Ubuntu Code of Conduct - 2.0"].
If there is need for accepting other code of conduct, it may be
adopted, given that reasonable and ethically sound arguments are
provided.
